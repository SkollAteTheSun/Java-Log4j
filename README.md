# Java-Log4j

Lab work on studying the rules of the code convention document, learning the basics of logging in Java using the log4j library.

Logging the main activities of applications using the log4j libraries.
Logs should be output to a file and to the console.
The logs output to the file should be divided into INFO, DEBUG, ERROR levels:
* write INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR and FATAL logs to one file
* in the second - only WARNING, ERROR and FATAL

Log mask for the intended event:
<level> <date> <time> (short class name) - <log text>
<error.printStackTrace> (for ERROR and FATAL)
